      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>
         Seam's mission is to provide a fully-integrated development platform
         for building rich, standards-based Internet applications tailored for
         traditional and cloud deployments.
      </para>

      <para>
         The Seam 3 project is organized as a collection of modules and
         developer tooling tailored for Java EE 6 application development, with
         <emphasis>Context and Dependency Injection</emphasis> (CDI) as the
         central link.
      </para>

      <para>
         Seam's modules leverage portable CDI extensions to build on the core
         Java EE functionality and integrate with JBoss and third-party
         projects. Together, these modules provide many of the popular features
         and integrations from Seam 2 (security, internationalization, JSF,
         rules, BPM) while also exploring new integrations and designs.
      </para>

      <para>
         The developer tooling for Seam is provided by JBoss Tools and Seam
         Forge. JBoss Tools enhances Eclipse with features designed to help
         developers write, test and deploy enterprise Java applications. Seam
         Forge is an incremental project enhancement API and shell. 
      </para>

      <para>
         This guide steps you through the modules and select tooling, covering
         the purpose, APIs and usage scenarios for each. Collectively, this
         software should give you everything you need to develop comprehensive,
         robust and compelling enterprise applications.
