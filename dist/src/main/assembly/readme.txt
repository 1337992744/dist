Seam ${project.version}
==========================

Seam is a powerful open source development platform for building rich Internet 
applications in Java. Seam integrates technologies such as Asynchronous 
JavaScript and XML (AJAX), JavaServer Faces (JSF), Java Persistence (JPA) and
Enterprise Java Beans (EJB 3.0) into a unified full-stack solution, complete 
with sophisticated tooling.

Seam has been designed from the ground up to eliminate complexity at both 
architecture and API levels. It enables developers to assemble complex web 
applications using simple annotated Java classes, a rich set of UI components, 
and very little XML. Seam's unique support for conversations and declarative 
state management can introduce a more sophisticated user experience while at 
the same time eliminating common bugs found in traditional web applications.
